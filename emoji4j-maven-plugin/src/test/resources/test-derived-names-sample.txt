# This file lists the values of the Name property.
# This property is specified by the derivation documented in
# Section 4.8 of the Unicode Standard, Version 13.0,
# based on the Name field in UnicodeData.txt,
# the Jamo_Short_Name property in Jamo.txt,
# and a specified list of pattern strings used to derive names
# for certain ranges of characters from their code points.
# This file provides a full listing of the derived values
# so that implementations do not have to properly
# code that derivation.
#
# The format is two fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value or range of code point values
# Field 1: Name property value or pattern.
#
# • Values containing a * character are patterns which
#   use the placeholder * in place of the code point in hex.
#   In such cases, the name property value for any code point in Field 0
#   is formed by replacing the '*' with that code point value
#   in the usual 4- to 6-digit hexadecimal format.
#
#   UAX #42 and its data files use a similar convention,
#   except that the metacharacter there is '#'.
#
#   For example, the Name property value of U+4E12,
#   generated from the pattern string "CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-*",
#   is CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E12.
#   Similarly, the Name property value of U+2F89F,
#   generated from the pattern string "CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-*",
#   is CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-2F89F.
